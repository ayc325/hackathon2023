# hackathon2023

(1) Team name - BlackJack

(2) Description of your project - Our project is a webpage about Bycatch Sensing Technology. We created a webpage about bycatch and proposed solution for bycatch. Kelly worked mostly on the technical aspects of the project such as writing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. Angela worked mostly on the design of the website by using Figma and finding/editing content for the webpage such as the remixed Scratch game, researching about bycatch, and youtube videos and images. In addition, we both worked together using Github and replit to collaborate.

(3) The impact that your project makes as it relates to climate change - Our goal with the website is to educate the younger generation and propose a solution to bycatch, catching unwanted/untargeted species and possibly killing the species in the process. This solution implements Google Lens by using AI and spacial sensing to detect and release any bycaught or unwanted species in the water before the nets are pulled up to the surface and/or before the animals are stuck in the nets. We purposely gamified the website to make it more kid-friendly so that educating them about the topic would be more entertaining.
